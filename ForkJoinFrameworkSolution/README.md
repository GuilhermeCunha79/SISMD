#  Fork/Join Framework Solution

The Fork/Join framework is used to implement a solution that recursively splits the task
into subtasks, processes them in parallel, and combines the results.
The Fork/Join framework is designed for tasks that can be broken down into smaller,
independent subtasks. It eciently utilizes all available processors and is suitable for
divide-and-conquer algorithms, potentially leading to signicant performance improvements.
