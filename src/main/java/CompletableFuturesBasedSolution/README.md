# CompletableFutures-Based Solution

This approach uses CompletableFuture for asynchronous programming. It allows tasks
to be executed in non-blocking ways and handles the composition of asynchronous operations.
CompletableFuture provides a high-level API for writing asynchronous code without
manually managing threads. It simplifies handling of dependent tasks and can lead to
more readable and maintainable code.
