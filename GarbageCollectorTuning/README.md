# Garbage Collector Tuning

Java provides several garbage collectors that operate concurrently with applications to
manage memory by reclaiming unused objects, employing dierent strategies to optimize
performance. You should provide evidence of such conguration work, including documentation or logs demonstrating the conguration and tuning of the garbage collector
used in your application, and clearly explain why you selected a particular garbage collector, referencing how it aligns with your application's performance characteristics and
resource usage patterns. Additionally, analyze how the chosen garbage collector aects
your application's performance and resource utilization, including any improvements observed.
