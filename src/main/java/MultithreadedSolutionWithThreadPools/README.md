# Multithreaded Solution (With Thread Pools)
This implementation utilizes thread pools to manage threads more eficiently. The thread
pool handles thread creation and reuse, reducing the overhead associated with thread
lifecycle management.
Using thread pools simplifies thread management and can lead to better resource
utilization. It allows for scalable solutions that can adjust the number of active threads
based on the workload and system capabilities.
